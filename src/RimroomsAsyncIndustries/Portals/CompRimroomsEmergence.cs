    /// ## Why this has to be a designation and can never be automatic

    /// 0.6.3-dev established that **a door the player built is never automatically a
    /// frontier**, because turning somebody's own wall door into a permanent way into the
    /// Backrooms would change an existing colony just by installing this mod — which
    /// `CONTENT_REUSE_POLICY.md` forbids outright.

    /// Emergence runs the other direction: the way out arrives **at** the player's own map.

    /// A marked door must stay on an **ordinary branch-owned map**. Marking a door inside a
    /// Backrooms coordinate is refused: a way out has to come up somewhere that is not the
